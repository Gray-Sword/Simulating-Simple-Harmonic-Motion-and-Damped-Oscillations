# Simulating-Simple-Harmonic-Motion-and-Damped-Oscillations
This Python project simulates simple harmonic and damped oscillations in a mass-spring system. It numerically solves differential equations to model motion under varying damping conditions, plotting position and velocity over time. Ideal for visualizing mechanics concepts and oscillatory behavior.
