# Damped Harmonic Oscillator Simulation

This project simulates simple harmonic motion (SHM) and damped oscillations of a mass-spring system using Python. By numerically solving the differential equations for motion, it models oscillatory behavior under different damping conditions and visualizes the results.

## Description

The simulation models two cases of harmonic oscillators:
1. **Simple Harmonic Motion** - no damping, showing constant amplitude oscillations.
2. **Damped Harmonic Motion** - includes a damping factor, where oscillations decrease over time due to resistive forces.

This project provides a clear visualization of how damping affects oscillatory motion, showcasing the physics concepts of simple harmonic motion, damping, and resonance.
